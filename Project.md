# H7 - Miniproject 

## By Teemu Koskinen

This file has all the steps how I accomplished this project and all the tests I did.

## Start 7.5.2022:

I will start this project by creating those three repositories I talked about before but I actually has to create just two because one of them already exist. 

The repositories that will be used in this project are Animesongs, Soturikissat and MyGunpla.

Let's test the main thing in this project that is the cloning multiple git repositories at the same time.

	$ git clone git@github.com:Teemu21/Animesongs.git git@github.com:Teemu21/Soturikissat.git git@github.com:Teemu21/MyGunpla.git
	
Let's test this.

	$ git clone git@github.com:Teemu21/Animesongs.git git@github.com:Teemu21/Soturikissat.git git@github.com:Teemu21/MyGunpla.git

Seems like that cloning multiple repositories even bt hand isn't as easy as I thought it would be.

After looking info in the internet I found out that you have to use && git clone to clone multiple git repositories in their own directories.

	$ git clone git@github.com:Teemu21/Animesongs.git && git clone git@github.com:Teemu21/Soturikissat.git && git clone git@github.com:Teemu21/MyGunpla.git

This way it seems to be working but I also found out about the program called repo that's suppose to help with multiple git repositories. I tried to install this "repo" program but I couldn't get it to work. 

## 13.5.2022:

Now that the main thing of this project can be done by hand let's try to make the Salt state of this command. I went to [Salt's](https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.cmd.html) own site to find info about cmd.run because I wanted to test how I could make git clone command an Salt state that doesn't change if I run it second time and I found about stateful argument that I believe will make it so that it won't try to clone my git repos again. My init.sls file looks like this:

![init](init.png) 

Let's test this state.

After testing this state I realized that it was useless because for some reason using Salt to clone git repo by SSH causes Permission Denied (publickey) error and after few hours looking into it I couldn't find any solution to this problem. Then I tried to clone it by using Git HTTPS and it kinda worked. I managed to clone the repository but it had wrong permissions. Basically only root user could do anything in that github repo. This was a big problem because after lot of trial and error I realized that even mode 777 in init.sls file didn't change the permissions. Then I tried to change them by hand and surprise surprise chmod worked but when I tried git add . command without sudo it gave me permission denied error. After this I realized that only way forward in this project was a shell script that would be runned on the minion manually after copying it from master to minions. Then the problem arose. How to run shell scripts on Windows? After a while I found a solution. Install Linux on Windows and I found perfect guide to it from [FOSS](https://itsfoss.com/install-bash-on-windows/). This guide is bit old if you are using Windows 11 but it works on it too. Tomorrow if I have time I will install Salt on my Ubuntu on Windows and day would be 14.5.2022.  

## 15.5.2022:

After running issues making Windows Subsystem for Linux to Salt minion. I realized that with WSL and Ubuntu installed that I could now use bash in normal Windows as well making in easy to copy and use shell scripts on Windows. FOSS guide for installing WSL and Ubuntu is good but to use git for cloning you will have to install SSH on your WSL machine and run ssh-keygen command. After this add your WSL machine's publickey to your Github. Otherwise it gives permission denied (publickey) error when trying to clone something by using shell script on Windows. These issues with Salt minion were there because my Salt master is in homenetwork which works in every situaion if all your minions are connected to same network but WSL has it's own virtual network so my master couldn't never find it and I tried change in it but it resulted in no connection to internet on the WSL machine. If your master is in an actual public ip address then Salt minion should work just fine. 

Now that bash issue on Windows has been solved. I can now make that shell script that will be copied to all minions.

![sh](sh.png)

Let's test this command.

	$ bash repos

	Enter file in which to save the key (/home/teemuk/.ssh/id_rsa): 
	/home/teemuk/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
	Overwrite (y/n)? n

Command seems to work fine but I didn't want it to overwrite old key so I typed n.

Time to test this command on a minion but first I will have to edit the old init.sls file that I created earlier.

Modified init.sls:

![init](init2.png)

Now I can test the command.

![rasp](rasp.jpg)

This command is succesful but it doesn't clone the repositories and ssh-keygen asks user input to work.

Maybe I could run ssh-keygen with cmd.run.

This was actually one the later tries to get this working but Salt always runs commands as root and I can't change them so I will have to give up this idea for automating ssh-keygen. Apparently I will have to make two shell scripts were one runs ssh-keygen and other clones the git repositories.

Newly modified init.sls:

![init](init3.png)

This command should now run on any Linux disto. Let's test it.

This state seems to work but Raspberry Pi didn't find the Micro from Raspberry Pi APT repository. Let's modify the init.sls again. While I tested that both shell scripts were working I realized that if I runned ssh first git could get error because it remembered what last command was and got wrong starting leters error. For me it was gene like from generating RSA keys...

Of course this isn't idempotence yet but at least we now have a Micro installed.

Let's make this beta state an idempotence.

![idempotent](unless.png)

Let's try this.

Well, Salt said my cmd.run had too many functions so I change it a litle.
