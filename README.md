# MyGitRepos

## By Teemu Koskinen

H7: My miniproject will be about Salt state that will install Git, SSH and Micro on the computer if necessary. It will also generate SSH public key automatically and clone my three Github repos to be ready on that computer when I want to edit those three repos. This state is meant to be working on both Windows and Linux distributions. This state is mainly for my own use but if someone has multiple Github repos that you want to edit on the new computer then my state might help you too. 

# State:

This project is currently in ALPHA state. You can test ALPHA with this command:

	git clone git@github.com:Teemu21/Animesongs.git && git clone git@github.com:Teemu21/MyGunpla.git && git clone git@github.com:Teemu21/Soturikissat.git
