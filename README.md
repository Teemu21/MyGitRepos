# MyGitRepos - By Teemu Koskinen
H7: My miniproject will be about Salt state that will install Git, SSH and Micro on the computer if necessary. It will also generate SSH public key automatically and clone my three Github repos to be ready on that computer when I want to edit those three repos. This state is meant to be working on both Windows and Linux distributions. This state is mainly for my own use but if someone has multiple Github repos that you want to edit on the new computer then my state might help you too. 

# State:

This project is currently in ALPHA state.

# Start 7.5.2022:

I will start this project by creating those three repositories I talked about before but I actually has to create just two because one of them already exist. 

The repositories that will be used in this project are Animesongs, Soturikissat and MyGunpla.

Let's test the main thing in this project that is the cloning multiple git repositories at the same time.

	$ git clone git@github.com:Teemu21/Animesongs.git git@github.com:Teemu21/Soturikissat.git git@github.com:Teemu21/MyGunpla.git
	
Let's test this.

	$ git clone git@github.com:Teemu21/Animesongs.git git@github.com:Teemu21/Soturikissat.git git@github.com:Teemu21/MyGunpla.git

Seems like that cloning multiple repositories even bt hand isn't as easy as I thought it would be.

After looking info in the internet I found out that you have to use && git clone to clone multiple git repositories in their own directories.

	$ git clone git@github.com:Teemu21/Animesongs.git && git clone git@github.com:Teemu21/Soturikissat.git && git clone git@github.com:Teemu21/MyGunpla.git

This way it seems to be working but I also found out about the program called repo that's suppose to help with multiple git repositories. I tried to install this "repo" program but I couldn't get it to work.
